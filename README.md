## With OpenAI-Compatible Chat Interface

This is a Streamlit-based chat interface for interacting with any OpenAI-compatible API. It supports managing multiple API configurations, dynamic model selection, and streaming responses.

## Features

- **Dynamic API Configuration**: Add, update, and manage API keys, base URLs, and default models.
- **Streaming Responses**: View responses from the API in real-time.
- **Chat History**: View chat history directly in the sidebar.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI powered by Streamlit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `streamlit`
  - `requests`
  - `json`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install streamlit requests
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Setup
Clone the repository and ensure the `api_config.json` file is available in the same directory as the script.

### Step 2: Run the Script
Start the Streamlit app by running:
```bash
streamlit run script_name.py
```

### Step 3: Configure APIs
1. Open the **Settings** section in the sidebar.
2. Add or update API configurations:
   - **API Key Name**: A unique name for the API.
   - **API Key Value**: The actual API key (hidden input).
   - **Base URL**: The endpoint of the API (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`).
   - **Default Model**: The model to use (fetched dynamically from the API).
3. Save configurations, and they will be stored in `api_config.json`.
4. Base urls:
  ``` 
  XAI_BASE_URL="https://api.x.ai/v1"
  GROQ_BASE_URL="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"
  OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
  OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1/"
```

### Step 4: Start Chatting
